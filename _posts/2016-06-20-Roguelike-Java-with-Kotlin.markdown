I'm writing this as a self tutorial in Kotlin and some common Java libraries that are used in roguelike game development.

This will follow the guide presented in [Trystan's Blog][trystan-blog] using [Ascii panel][ascii-p], JetBrain's [IDEA IDE][idea-ce], and will be done in a Linux dev environment. Following Trystan's tutorial does include information on getting setup running a Java applet, but I will not be translating it (as I don't really care about that portion).

I will be making commits to my [Github repo][gh-repo] for each section in the tutorial, along with code and explanations on what was changed and why.
